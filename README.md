# ESTR1002-Solutions
A collection of ESTR1002 programming problems and their solutions in C.
## Background
The C source files are solutions to programming problems (competitive programming style) given in the lab session
of ESTR1002 (2023-2024, 1st term) from CU. Each lab has a different theme (e.g. loops, strings) and a range of
difficulty accross the topic, from exercise 1 being the easiest to exercise 5 being the hardest.
## Comments
The questions posted are not too difficult, with question 1s being mostly an implementation of the fundamentals,
while question 5s requires some thinking, but sophisticated algorithms are not need, only some clever thinking.
In my opinion they are a good way for beginner programmers to learn the ropes while also being challenging
enough to prompt thinking and discovery, and gain the satisfaction of all AC green ticks on DMOJ.
## Ownership
The questions are given by the course (Credits: Prof. [FU Chi Wing, Philip](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cwfu/),
Mr. ZHOU Mingjun, Mr. GE Jiahao) and will not be available online. Solutions are mine and is given in this repository.
## Traversing the repository
Most of the solution files are given here for now. Some of the files are missing, which is my fault of being too lazy.
## Executing and testing the code
Each source file can be built into an executable with no dependencies, much like the style on *Codeforces*. Almost
all of the source files uploaded have passed the official test cases, even though the test cases are not given. Make
use of your imagination to come up with more test cases to debug your program.
